It's like Yelp, but for camping sites. Built with NodeJS, Express, mongoDB and a touch of Bootstrap.

Built as part of the Web Developer Bootcamp on Udemy.

## TODO

- [ ] Cool header image for this readme
- [x] CSS => SCSS for styling
- [x] Gulp build SCSS (now includes Autoprefixer)
- [x] Gulp compile Bootstrap locally (I wanted to see if I could, and I can)
- [ ] Concatenate both CSS sheets together
